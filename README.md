- Addressing Overfitting(high variance) /Underfitting (high bias)
  - Regularization - minimize overfitting, add cost to to the parameter L1 (absolute value of the sum), L2 (square value of the parameters) 
  - Feature extraction - create new features from existing features
- Tuning
  - Hyperparameter Tuning - depends on model architecture, set by the engineer, not part of the estimation
- Model Evaluation Metrics
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1
